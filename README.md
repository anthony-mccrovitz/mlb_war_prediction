# MLB Player WAR Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict MLB players' Wins Above Replacement (WAR) based on historical data. The primary focus is on data cleaning, feature selection, machine learning model training, back-testing, and evaluation to make accurate predictions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**:
    - Historical baseball data was collected using the `pybaseball` library.
    - Data cleaning processes were implemented to ensure the dataset's accuracy and completeness.

2. **Feature Selection**:
    - Feature selection techniques were employed to identify the most relevant features for our predictive model.
    - This step helps in reducing the complexity of the model and improving its performance.

3. **Model Training**:
    - Various machine learning algorithms were explored and trained to predict the WAR of MLB players.
    - The models were trained on historical data and evaluated using back-testing techniques.

4. **Back-Testing System**:
    - A robust back-testing system was developed to validate the predictions.
    - This system ensures that the model's predictions are reliable and accurate over different seasons.

5. **Model Evaluation and Improvement**:
    - The model's predictions were evaluated based on error metrics.
    - Continuous improvements were made to reduce prediction errors and enhance model performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pybaseball`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn pybaseball
\`\`\`

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlb-war-prediction.git
cd mlb-war-prediction
\`\`\`

2. Prepare the data by running the data cleaning scripts provided in the `data` directory.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis and model training process:

\`\`\`bash
jupyter notebook next_warlive.ipynb
\`\`\`

### Data

The primary dataset used in this project is the `batting.csv` file, which contains historical batting statistics of MLB players. This file is located in the `data` directory.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Load the data from `batting.csv`.
    - Handle missing values and outliers.
    - Normalize and preprocess the data.

2. **Feature Selection**:
    - Use correlation analysis and other techniques to select important features.
    - Create a refined dataset with selected features.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train multiple machine learning models.
    - Evaluate the models using back-testing.

4. **Prediction and Improvement**:
    - Generate predictions using the trained models.
    - Evaluate the predictions using error metrics.
    - Iterate to improve model accuracy.

## Areas for Potential Improvement

1. **Feature Engineering**:
    - Explore additional features that could improve model accuracy.
    - Consider domain-specific knowledge to create new features.

2. **Advanced Machine Learning Techniques**:
    - Experiment with advanced algorithms like ensemble methods, neural networks, etc.
    - Use hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

3. **Model Interpretability**:
    - Implement techniques to interpret model predictions.
    - Provide insights into why certain predictions are made.

4. **Deployment**:
    - Create a deployment pipeline to make predictions in real-time.
    - Integrate the model with a web application or API.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting MLB players' WAR using historical data. Through data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation, we aim to build a robust predictive model. Future work can focus on improving feature engineering, experimenting with advanced techniques, and deploying the model for real-time predictions.
